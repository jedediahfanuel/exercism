The Head of IT prorgammed an awesome code and he wants to test it.

He gives you the task to code a UK postcode generator so he can test his own code. He knows you are new to this business and the generated postcode doesn't have to be real ones.

Your generated postcode should have this format: "WN8 5WE" AKA "LLnsnLL"

L stands for a capitalized letter, n for number and s for space.
